# Research PWA with Reactjs

This project/App is set and configured to build PWA(Progresive Web Application) with react and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


```
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `serve -s build`

to run the app with the aid of a static server. We are going to use the serve npm package to, wait for it, serve the React app. If not work, use the following commands to install serve on your computer and also set up a static server for the app:

```
npm i serve -g
```
